# Purpose of AI Usage

AI tools were used as a learning assistant to:

- Improve code structure and organization
- Debug JavaScript and CSS issues
- Generate feature ideas
- Enhance documentation quality
- Refine written descriptions for clarity and professionalism

The AI was not used to automatically generate the entire project. Instead, it was used as a guided development assistant.

# How AI Was Utilized
### Debugging and Error Resolution

AI helped identify and resolve:
-Incorrect script placement inside the <body>
-DOM loading timing issues
-Event listener errors
-JavaScript file linking problems

For example, when the theme toggle did not work, AI helped diagnose that the <script> tag was placed before the DOM elements were loaded.

### Feature Implementation Guidance

AI provided structured guidance for implementing:
- Dark/Light Theme Toggle using class toggling
- Time-Based Greeting Message using Date().getHours()
- Responsive design improvements
- Clean project structure organization

All features were implemented manually after understanding the explanation.

### Documentation Support

I wrote all of the project documentation myself. AI was used only to improve the grammar, sentence flow, and readability of the text, not to generate content or ideas.

AI assisted in improving the quality of the project documentation, including:

- Developing a professional and well-organized README file
- Refining project descriptions for clarity and coherence
- Enhancing explanations of technical features to ensure accuracy and readability

All documentation was carefully reviewed, edited, and customized by me before submission to ensure it fully reflects my own understanding and work.

The AI assistance for all improvements mentioned was mainly provided by the Kilo extension in VS Code and ChatGPT.
